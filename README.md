# Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to analyze the number of complaints received in Saudi Arabian airports during the third quarter of 2024 using open data provided by the General Authority of Civil Aviation. This analysis aims to identify trends in complaint numbers across various airports, determine monthly complaint patterns, and highlight any specific airports with notably high complaint rates. This project will not include detailed information about the nature of the complaints, focusing instead on volume and distribution.
# Steps Followed

1. Define Project Objectives and Hypotheses
 • Objective: Analyze the volume and distribution of complaints in Saudi airports for the third quarter of 2024.
 • Hypotheses:
 • Some airports may receive significantly more complaints than others.
 • There may be a monthly trend or seasonal pattern in complaint numbers.
 2. Data Collection
 • Accessed the General Authority of Civil Aviation’s open data platform.
 • Downloaded data related to airport complaints, ensuring it included dates, airport names, and complaint counts.
 3. Data Cleaning and Preparation
 • Data Cleaning:
 • Checked for missing or inconsistent data, such as incomplete complaint counts or invalid dates.
 • Filtered data to only include the third quarter (July, August, and September).
 • Standardization:
 • Ensured uniform formats for date columns and standardized airport names.
 4. Data Analysis
 • General Analysis:
 • Calculated the total number of complaints per airport.
 • Summed monthly complaint totals (July, August, and September) to observe monthly trends.
 • Comparative Analysis:
 • Compared major airports (e.g., King Khalid International, King Abdulaziz International) to determine which had higher complaint volumes.
 • Analyzed complaint distribution by region if geographic data was available.
 5. Data Visualization
 • Utilized tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create visual representations:
 • Bar Chart: Displayed complaint counts per airport.
 • Line Chart: Illustrated trends in complaints over the three months.
 • Pie Chart: Showed complaint distribution among different airports.
 6. Insights and Recommendations
 • Analyzed results to address project hypotheses:
 • Identified the airport with the highest complaint volume.
 • Noted any significant monthly increases or decreases in complaint numbers.
 • Suggested general recommendations, such as additional staffing during peak times or targeted improvements based on identified trends.
 7. Final Report Preparation
 • Compiled a report summarizing:
 • Executive Summary: Objective, data collection, and analysis overview.
 • Analysis Results: Findings with visualizations.
 • Conclusions: Confirmed or disproved hypotheses.
 • Recommendations: Suggested actions for improving the customer experience at airports.
